Weathimal - minimalist weather page


Hopefully it should be as easy as opening the web page and typing in a zip code.
Currently, only zip codes are accepted for location information.


With more time, I would like to have added
  -the ability for city,state,country format
  -smoother transitions
  -temperature data (and more data in general in an optional toggle)
  -variable # of days displayed
  -more and better icons
  -working better with browser resizing
  -more?
  
  
Please let me know what you think.
